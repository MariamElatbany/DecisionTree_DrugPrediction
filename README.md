# DecisionTree_DrugPrediction

## Project Overview
This project explores **Decision Tree classification**, a powerful machine learning technique for making data-driven decisions. 
We aim to predict the recommended drug based on patient health parameters using a real-world dataset.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains patient health features and the corresponding drug recommended.
- Features include: Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, NaN values handled, etc.
- Target variable: `Drug` (encoded as `Drug_num` for modeling).

## Objectives
- Develop a classification model using the **Decision Tree algorithm**.
- Visualize the tree to understand decision criteria.
- Evaluate the model performance using **accuracy**

## Technologies & Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
